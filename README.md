# tools-barebone
## A barebone infrastructure to add new tools sections

To test the barebone, you can run directly this app.

In general, however, to develop a new tool you just need 
to build the image provided here (`./build-docker.sh`) 
and then you can work directly on your own app. 


For a simple example of a tool developed using `tools-barebone`, 
you can give a look at the [tools-example](https://github.com/materialscloud-org/tools-example).
